## Why "Sprocket Pan"?

When Insomnia announced their user account requirements, many people at the company I worked at were panicked, searching for a good alternative to Insomnia. A group of engineers decided to get together to build the tool themself, as they could then integrate with company-specific features while having something reliable and useful. They pitched the name "Rocket Man" a play on the original Postman that they would be emulating. When discussing the application framework to use, I suggested [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), a multi-platform framework built in rust, with blazing fast built speeds, tiny memory and storage footprints, and an active development community behind it. Others at the company fought back against Tauri, fearing that the Rust language would be too hard for developers to work in. Given that an [absolutely miniscule amount](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aitaifish%2FSprocket-Pan++language%3ARust&type=code) of Sprocket Pan is actually Rust, their fears were unfounded for multiple reasons, but it was enough for them to work on Rocket Man in Electron. I decided to build my own application, with ~~blackjack and hookers~~ Rust and Typescript. I named it Sprocket Pan, a spoof on the already-a-spoof-of-something-else Rocket Man.
