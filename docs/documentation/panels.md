# Panels

## Settings

The Settings Panel allows the user to change different settings within Sprocket Pan. Settings are per-workspace. The Settings Panel can be opened with the gear button in the toolbar.

Whenever a setting is changed, the buttons in the bottom life corner will change to `Cancel` and `Apply` respectively. Click the `Cancel` button to clear all changes, or the `Apply` button to save changes.

There are three sub-sections within the settings panel - `general`, `requests`, and `data`.

### General

![Settings Panel - General](../assets/images/getting-started/panels/settings-panel-general.png)

In the general settings menu, you can control the window zoom, the system theme (dark or light mode), and how you want variables to be displayed. The variable display setting is used for [environment](../terminology/#environment) variables. The below example(s) show what it looks like for each setting:

* Key and Value

* Value Only

### Requests

The request settings menu has the options for the network call timeout duration, the maximum number of [history](../terminology/#history) records, and the [script](../terminology/#script) strategy order. For the network call timeout duration

### Data

![Settings Panel - Data](../assets/images/getting-started/panels/settings-panel-data.png)

The data folder deals with saving, quitting to the [workspace selection screen](../../getting-started/layout/#workspace-selection-screen), and opening the data folder in your system's file explorer. You will rarely need to do this, but the `Open Data Folder` button will open the location of all of the data in Sprocket Pan in your system's file explorer.
