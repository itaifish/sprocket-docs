# Sprocket Pan

A tool for sending HTTP(S) requests over the internet - essentialy a UI on top of [curl](https://curl.se/) plus some quality-of-life features. Similar to [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

## Inspiration

Postman has been the go-to tool for developers to test their RESTful (and other types of) APIs for the good part of the last decade. However, [recent changes to Postman](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/17wqn5a/fuck_you_postman/) have made it such that you need to create an account to gain full functionality of the tool, and Postman actually deleted the user data of everyone who didn't migrate. Insomnia, which bills itself as a FOSS alternative, also recently pushed an [update mirroring Postman's changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ak7wtk/with_insomnia_now_joining_postman_in_forcing/).

The enshittifaction of the internet has to stop. Greed drives everyday descision-making, and public tools have been constantly limit-tested against the willingness of end-users to put up with each additional pay-wall or data-wall. Sprocket Pan was just built for me, in order to have a tool that I know is free, secure, cloudless, and rich in features. However, in the spirit of open source, and in honor of all of the incredible free tools that I use every day, I wanted to make Sprocket Pan available for everyone. We will never charge money for anything, we will never collect or harvest any data (and/or train your data on an AI), and Sprocket Pan will always be FOSS.

## Why "Sprocket Pan"?

When Insomnia announced their user account requirements, many people at the company I worked at were panicked, searching for a good alternative to Insomnia. A group of engineers decided to get together to build the tool themself, as they could then integrate with company-specific features while having something reliable and useful. They pitched the name "Rocket Man" a play on the original Postman that they would be emulating. When discussing the application framework to use, I suggested [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), a multi-platform framework built in rust, with blazing fast built speeds, tiny memory and storage footprints, and an active development community behind it. Others at the company fought back against Tauri, fearing that the Rust language would be too hard for developers to work in. Given that an [absolutely miniscule amount](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aitaifish%2FSprocket-Pan++language%3ARust&type=code) of Sprocket Pan is actually Rust, their fears were unfounded for multiple reasons, but it was enough for them to work on Rocket Man in Electron. I decided to build my own application, with ~~blackjack and hookers~~ Rust and Typescript. I named it Sprocket Pan, a spoof on the already-a-spoof-of-something-else Rocket Man.
